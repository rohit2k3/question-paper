            <h3>Define the expression for form factor and peak factor</h3>
        </legend>
        <p>Form factor is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of the waveform to its average value over one complete cycle. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:<br><br>

            <b>Form factor = RMS value of waveform / Average value of waveform over one cycle</b><br><br>
            
            Peak factor is defined as the ratio of the peak value of the waveform to its RMS value. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:<br><br>

            <h3>Define power factor  </h3>
        </legend>
       <p>Power factor is a measure of how efficiently electrical power is being used in an AC (alternating current) electrical system. It is defined as the ratio of the real power (measured in watts) to the apparent power (measured in volt-amperes). In other words, power factor is a measure of how much of the total electrical power being supplied to a system is actually being used to do useful work, and how much is being wasted.</p>

            <h3>Define a slip of an induction motor</h3>
        </legend>
       <p>A slip in an induction motor refers to the difference between the synchronous speed of the rotating magnetic field in the stator and the actual speed of the rotor.<br>
        Slip is expressed as a percentage of the synchronous speed and is calculated using the following formula:
        <br>
        <br>
        Slip = (Synchronous speed - Actual speed)/Synchronous speed x 100%

            <h3>What is called synchronous speed in AC machines </h3>
        </legend>
       <p>Synchronous speed in AC machines refers to the speed at which the rotating magnetic field generated by the stator of the machine rotates. This speed is determined by the frequency of the AC power supply and the number of poles in the machine. Specifically, the synchronous speed of an AC machine can be calculated using the following formula:.<br><br>
        Synchronous speed (in revolutions per minute) = (120 x frequency) / number of poles

        <p>An ideal current source is by definition a two-terminal element with the property that the current flowing through the device is specified at every instant in time.<br> <br>
        By definition, an ideal voltage source is a two-terminal element with the property that the voltage across the terminals is specified at every instant in time.

            <h3>Define active and passive elements</h3>
        </legend>
        <p>An <strong>active component</strong> is an electronic component which supplies energy to a circuit. Active elements have the ability to electrically control electron flow (i.e. the flow of charge). All electronic circuits must contain at least one active component.</p>
        <p>An <strong>passive component</strong> is an electronic component which can only receive energy, which it can either dissipate, absorb or store it in an electric field or a magnetic field. Passive elements do not need any form of electrical power to operate.</p>

        <legend>
            <h3>Classify the types of losses in transformer</h3>
        </legend>
        <p>We know that reactive loads such as inductors and capacitors dissipate zero power, yet the fact that they drop voltage and draw current gives the deceptive impression that they actually do dissipate power. This “phantom power” is called <strong>reactive power</strong>. <br> <br></p>
        <p>The actual amount of power being used, or dissipated, in a circuit is called <strong>true power</strong>. <br> <br></p>
        <p>The combination of reactive power and true power is called <strong>apparent power</strong>. <br> <br></p>

        <p>The speed regulation of a motor is defined as the change in the speed from full-load to no-load and is expressed as a percentage of the full-load speed</p>
